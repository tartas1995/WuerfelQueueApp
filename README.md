# WürfelQueue App

This app was made with the intention to make it easier to play WürfelQueue.

It connects to the League of Legends Client API and retrieves the champions owned by the player and retrieves data from the lobby. (banned champions, etc...) Then it will make a sugguestion based on the mode it is currently in.

## Modes

###### 100% random
it will sugguest a random champion.
###### Role based
it will sugguest a random champion that riot games views as matching your role.
